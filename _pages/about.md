<!-- Life conundrum 1: I am a graduate student who wishes that graduate school never ended. 

<!-- Life conundrum 2: I find both mathematical equations and biological experiments beautiful.  -->

I am a computational biologist interested in the role of mechanics in the evolution, development, and function in biological systems. I have worked on understanding the role of mechanical stability on animal morphology and motor control. More recently, I have expanded my studies to include the role of mechanics in the morphogenesis and function of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system. Learn more about my research [here](https://neelimasharma.com/research/). 

<!-- I am presently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Shubin Lab](https://shubinlab.uchicago.edu) at the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, University of Chicago. My Ph.D. was at the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Sciences at Yale University in the [Biomechanics and Control Lab](https://mvlab.yale.edu), advised by Prof. Madhu Venkadesan.  -->
