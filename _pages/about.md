<!-- Life conundrum 1: I am a graduate student who wishes that graduate school never ended. 

<!-- Life conundrum 2: I find both mathematical equations and biological experiments beautiful.  -->

In my research, I am interested in learning the effect of mechanics on the morphology, control, and development of animals. In my past research, I explored the role of mechanical stability on animal morphology and neural control. More recently, I am understanding the role of mechanics in the morphogenesis and function of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system. 

I am presently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Shubin Lab](shubinlab.uchicago.edu) at the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, University of Chicago. My Ph.D. was at the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Sciences at Yale University in the [Biomechanics and Control Lab](mvlab.yale.edu) under the mentorship of Prof. Madhu Venkadesan.
