### Mechanical stability constraints form

**_Aspect ratio of animals_**: 
The systematic increase in the body’s slenderness from sprawling insects that weigh milligrams to elephants that weigh over a thousand kilograms is a fundamental allometric relation apparent in terrestrial animals. Because natural terrains are often rough and uneven, the slenderness of an animal affects the ability to not fall down and maintain a stable upright posture. An animal with the same height but a wider base of support is less slender and therefore more stable on uneven terrains. We wondered whether the geophysical properties of our planet, namely the statistical properties of terrain unevenness underlies this allometric scaling of body shape. For natural terrains, the height variation between two points is known to be related to the horizontal separation between the points according to a power law. Using measured terrain statistics and the conditions for stability, we find that lighter animals need a wider base than height. This physics-based model, informed solely by data on terrain statistics, is predictive of animal data on mass versus slenderness over a span of eight orders of magnitude. Small animals, therefore, face a disproportionately more uneven terrain than that faced by larger animals. Besides highlighting the importance of considering environmental factors in evolution, these results suggest design constraints on robots of the future that will locomote over natural terrains much as animals do.
**_Muscle impedance and fingertip force production_**: 
Human hands are adept at grasping. Studies on human grasping examine force and form closure of the object, the role of tactile sensory afferents in avoiding object falls, and the muscle coordination patterns during stable and perturbed grasps. However, the stability of the finger itself is inadequately studied. A simple DIY experiment reveals the problem. If we push on a rigid surface using our fingertip with large fingertip forces, the finger posture sometimes buckles. Analysis of a mathematical model of a finger-like manipulator reveals that the dynamics of the manipulator with the surface in contact make the posture and the force unstable. Our experiments show that the timescale of this instability is ~15 ms. In comparison, the fastest neural delays are 65 ms. As a result, contact stability cannot rely on feedback control. However, healthy humans routinely grasp objects stably; it remains unclear how people maintain stable fingertip contacts. We predict that people rely on the intrinsic mechanical properties of the muscles. The buckling of fingers is like buckling of columns, and columns resist compressive loads in proportion to their stiffness. So we ask if muscle stiffness also limits fingertip forces. Our first experiment showed that humans buckled at their maximal fingertip forces. If the maximal forces are not limited by muscle strength but by stability, then increasing the stiffness by external means should increase the fingertip forces. We test our hypothesis in an experiment where we externally stabilize the finger by attaching stiff splints. In consequence, we measure that the largest fingertip force increases. Therefore, we conclude that people rely on muscle stiffness for stable contacts. Moreover, muscle stiffness and not muscle strengths limit the peak fingertip forces. 
**_Morphology of joints in animals_**: 
Flexural joints are becoming increasingly prevalent in monolithic robotic limbs. A flexural joint is made up of a soft elastic interconnecting piece, called the flexure, between two stiffer segments. When the joint is flexed by an external force, most of the flexion is concentrated within the soft flexural element. While several detailed analyses exist for specific geometries of flexures, an all encapsulating theory for flexure function is missing. We use simple models to specifically characterize how the stiffness of flexure scales with size. We find that stable flexures severely limit the maximal rotation of actuated flexural joints, with typical values of rotation being less than 0.2 radians. This limit is independent of the size of the joint. In calculating this bound, we optimistically assume that the joints are actuated by motors whose torque density is as high as biological muscle. These results call into question the feasibility of flexural joints, especially for mobile or lightweight applications that use weaker actuators. We find the scaling relationships for the range of rotation of an actuated flexural joint as a function of the flexure’s material properties, cross-sectional geometry, and the torque density of the actuator. These results provide guidelines for the design and development of scalable flexural robotic limbs.
