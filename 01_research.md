# How does the need to remain mechanically stable impose constraints on body form and function? 

## Aspect ratio of animals: 

A fundamental allometric relationship in terrestrial animals is the systematic increase in the body’s slenderness from sprawling insects that weigh milligrams to erect elephants that weigh over a thousand kilograms. Because natural terrains are often rough and uneven, the slenderness of an animal affects the ability to not fall down and maintain a stable upright posture. An animal with the same height but a wider base of support is less slender and therefore more stable on uneven terrains. We wondered whether the geophysical properties of our planet, namely the statistical properties of terrain unevenness underlies this allometric scaling of body shape. For natural terrains, the height variation between two points is known to be related to the horizontal separation between the points according to a power law. Using measured terrain statistics and the conditions for stability, we find that lighter animals have to necessarily have a wider base than height. This physics-based model, informed solely by data on terrain statistics, is predictive of animal data on mass versus slenderness over a span of eight orders of magnitude. Small animals, therefore, face a terrain that is disproportionately more uneven than that faced by larger animals. Besides highlighting the importance of considering environmental factors in evolution, these results suggest design constraints on robots of the future that will locomote over natural terrains much as animals do.

## Muscle impedance and fingertip force production: 
When a manipulator contacts an external surface, the coupled dynamics of the manipulator and the surface can lead to instabilities in the contact force and in posture. One example of a postural instability is pushing a tool such as a screwdriver against a rigid surface1. The orientation of the screwdriver becomes increasingly unstable at higher forces, and a stabilizing impedance from co-activating muscles of the hand is one mechanism to stabilize the screwdriver 1 . A similar instability arises when pushing on a rigid surface using your fingertip, and the finger is prone to a buckling-like instability. Using experiments and mathematical analyses we show that the time scale of this instability is around 10 ms, which is at least ten times smaller than the fastest possible neural feed- back control. Therefore, even for this routine task, muscle impedance is likely necessary to maintain postural stability. The severity of this instability, like for the example of the screwdriver, depends on the magnitude of the contact force. We show that stability can be maintained at all forces if the finger is driven by actuators whose stiffness is at least linearly proportional to the force output. It is well known that biological muscles possess exactly this form of force- dependent stiffness2. However, our analysis predicts that when producing maximal fingertip forces, the intrinsic stiffness of muscle is insufficient to maintain postural stability, and therefore externally stiffening the joint using passive restraints should lead to an in- crease in maximal force production. If stability was primarily driven by feedback control, this prediction would not be true. We test this prediction using hu- man subject experiments and find agreement with the analyses. Therefore, humans rely nearly exclusively on muscle impedance to stabilize fingertip contacts.

## Morphology of joints in animals: 
Flexural joints are becoming increasingly prevalent in monolithic robotic limbs. A flexural joint is made up of a soft elastic interconnecting piece, called the flexure, between two stiffer segments. When the joint is flexed by an external force, most of the flexion is concentrated within the soft flexural element. While several detailed analyses exist for specific geometries of flexures, an all encapsulating theory for flexure function is missing from the literature. Motivated by this absence, we use simple models to specifically characterize how the stiffness of a flexure scales with size. We find that stable flexures severely limit the maximal rotation of actuated flexural joints, with typical values of rotation being less than 0.2 radians. This limit is independent of the size of the joint. In calculating this bound, we optimistically assume that the joints are actuated by motors whose torque density is as high as biological muscle. These results call into question the feasibility of flexural joints, especially for mobile or lightweight applications that use weaker actuators. Finally, we derive scaling relationships for the range of rotation of an actuated flexural joint as a function of the flexure’s material properties, cross-sectional geometry, and the torque density of the actuator. These results provide guidelines for the design and development of scalable flexural robotic limbs.
