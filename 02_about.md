I am a PhD student advised by Prof. Madhusudhan Venkadesan in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Sciences at the Yale University. I am also a student at the Yaleâ€™s Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology (PEB). I am interested in looking at how morphology and anatomical design in animals affects their body functioning and control. Specifically, I pay attention to the stability of various structures comprising the body of the animals. Recently, I have also developed an interest in muscle mechanics and robotic hands.
